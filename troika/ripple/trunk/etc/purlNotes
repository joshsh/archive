Using PURL

I use another sollution. I created a PURL (purl.org) pointing to my FOAF profile (http://purl.org/jspetrak/profile-foaf) and in that a resource with ID #dj. Then my URI is http://purl.org/jspetrak/profile-foaf#dj. Is it good or bad sollution. IMHO it keeps the URI really persistent.

I just tried it in the tabulator and it looks fine. I was a little worried about interactions between redirections and fragments, but the tabulator seems to get it right.

Purls are great for persistence, indeed.
