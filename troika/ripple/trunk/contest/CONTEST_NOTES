Ripple provides for a single RDF query operation: forward traversal from a given subject, through a given predicate, to zero or more objects.  Ripple does not allow global operations, such as queries for all subjects or all predicates in a graph, all statements about a given subject, etc.  Neither does it allow for the other common path operation, backward traversal.  While the Java implementation uses a variety of RDF operations internally, Ripple queries themselves are, by design, strictly limited to forward traversal.
* it makes queries simpler
* it allows Ripple to identify a Property with a single function
* it affords interesting opportunities for context and data hiding
* it preserves referential transparency.  It tends to be the case when working with dereferenceable URIs that all of the statements about a given subject come from a single source.  Ripple is only a "functional" language insofar as the data it works with has this property
