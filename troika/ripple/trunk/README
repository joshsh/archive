Please report them to parcour@gmail.com.

Known issues include:
* literals are not always compared properly, so (2 2 /equal) or
  ("foo" "foo" /equal) is sometimes false.
* the dereferencer is dumb enough to try and resolve mailto: and other
  non-dereferenceable URIs, and complain when it fails
* namespace prefix collisions are handled poorly (Sesame bug fixed in trunk)
* the RDF/XML dumps produced by @saveas occasionally contain an empty string
  literal as object instead of a blank node with the expected edges.  @export,
  which passes individual statements to a handler, has not had this problem
* interpreter hangs on @quit after @saveas, or at least it did once
* null lists -- () -- cause NullPointerExceptions, which they should not
