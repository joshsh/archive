Exception handling
================================================================================
* decide on an extensible approach for exception handling and error logging

Syntax
================================================================================
* periods for composition may not work, as the period is a valid character in the local part of a URI
	Beau.mother.father
	Beau:mother:*father:?neighbor
	:  :*  :+  :?  :{x}
	#42

Names and namespaces
================================================================================
* decide whether names are determined by URI, rdfs:label, some combination of the two, or something else entirely
* address name collisions, scalability issues in general

Nice-to-have
================================================================================
* Swoogle add-on, which performs queries like the one below, then uses the
  result to grab potential models for importing.
