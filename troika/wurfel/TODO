Build
================================================================================
* investigate the Maven error "Embedded error: The source must not be a directory."

Exception handling
================================================================================
* decide on an extensible approach for exception handling and error logging
* wrap calls to foreign code in strict try{...}catch(Throwable t){...} blocks for better error recovery

Syntax
================================================================================
* periods for composition may not work, as the period is a valid character in the local part of a URI
	Beau.mother.father
	Beau:mother:*father:?neighbor
	:  :*  :+  :?  :{x}
	#42

Model
================================================================================
* write a primitive which imports a document as a reified graph in which all subjects are bnodes

Scuttering
================================================================================
* let Dereferencers remember not only the graphs they have already imported, but also those they have tried and failed to import (to avoid repetitive failure)

Concurrency
================================================================================
* explore thread pooling and concurrency
* make all initializers thread-safe.  Make good use of the 'volatile' keyword

Event handling
================================================================================
* investigate java.util.EventObject, java.util.EventListener

Names and namespaces
================================================================================
* decide whether names are determined by URI, rdfs:label, some combination of the two, or something else entirely
* address name collisions, scalability issues in general

Command line interface
================================================================================
* blank node syntax, e.g. _:bar
* writer.debug becomes huge.  Disable it.
* interpreter hangs on multi-line comments
* implement an as-you-type parser for tab completion
* place multiple-line expressions in the history

OpenRDF
================================================================================
* Create and use a single Connection object for the evaluation of a single Expression, rather than one Connection object for each operation.  Look into connection pooling.

Ontologies
================================================================================
* ontology describing SemanticWebDocuments and where to get them

Testing
================================================================================
* syntax testing (both success and failure cases)
* test of the context filter

Use cases
================================================================================
* data hiding use case
* implicit context use case
* distributed programming use case
* DL or other reasoning use case
* later: concurrent programming use case

Nice-to-have
================================================================================
* Swoogle add-on, which performs queries like the one below, then uses the
  result to grab potential models for importing.
      http://logos.cs.umbc.edu:8080/swoogle31/q?queryType=search_swd_ontology&searchString=parrot&key=demo
* RSS reader
* Atom reader

* Wikipedia3 stuff

Bugs
================================================================================
* repository import occasionally hangs.  Time it out so you don't have to quit the application
* forgot to close a connection somewhere:
  [WARNING] Closing dangling connection due to garbage collection
* sha1SumOf yields a different result than the foaf-a-matic
