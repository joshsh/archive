Build
================================================================================
* place the required RDF documents (wurfel, wurfel-test, wurfel-misc) into the JAR itself so that Wurfel is not dependent on network connectivity to fortytwo.net
* install Trac
* prevent the build from succeeding when ANTLR parser generation fails

Exception handling
================================================================================
* decide on an extensible approach for exception handling and error logging
* wrap calls to foreign code in strict try{...}catch(Throwable t){...} blocks for better error recovery

Syntax
================================================================================
* edit grammar to more closely resemble Turtle / NTriples
* add character literal syntax, e.g. 'c'
* add awareness of the xml:lang and data type of literals in input grammar

Model
================================================================================
* handle translation of data between RDF and Function data structures
* write a primitive which imports a document as a reified graph in which all subjects are bnodes
* investigate data mapping between OpenRDF objects and Wurfel expressions, specifically, whether there would be performance savings in wrapping OpenRDF objects so as to avoid the use of instanceof
* make LazyEvaluator truly lazy, as well as more efficient

Primitives
================================================================================
* Add a sample Primitive or two which deal with the rdf:XMLLiteral type, if OpenRDF makes this possible

Scuttering
================================================================================
* look into adding a FOAF scutterer which can handle:
  * foaf:knows links
  * owl:sameAs indirection
  * rdfs:seeAlso / something like the mbox breadcrumbs protocol described in the Tabulator intro
* ponder the implications of purl URIs like this one (note: Disco can't handle this, either):
    http://purl.org/stuff/rev#Review
* dereference this: http://www.holygoat.co.uk/owl/redwood/0.1/tags/associatedTag

Server
================================================================================
* REST query format and service endpoint.  Returns a graph in RDF/XML... which may be simply a list of indirection nodes to results.
* dbpedia server (not necessarily using Wurfel)
* RFC server
* server for HTTP response codes
* servers for "recreational" data sets like chat channels, RPGs, virtual environments like ActiveWorlds, etc.

Concurrency
================================================================================
* explore thread pooling and concurrency
* make all initializers thread-safe.  Make good use of the 'volatile' keyword

Event handling
================================================================================
* investigate java.util.EventObject, java.util.EventListener

Names and namespaces
================================================================================
* decide whether names are determined by URI, rdfs:label, some combination of the two, or something else entirely
* address name collisions, scalability issues in general
* add ability to define terms in the default namespace, then save them
* handle name collisions in a more flexible and configurable way
* make "prefix discovery" a configurable feature
* investigate relative URIs for Wurfel vocabularies, so I don't have to change them every time I change the location of the vocabulary

Command line interface
================================================================================
* make ContainerTreeView's output look like Turtle/Wurfel input
* interpreter hangs on multi-line comments
* implement an as-you-type parser for tab completion
* place multiple-line expressions in the history
* make Lexicon updatable, without having to rebuild the dictionaries from scratch whenever the model changes

OpenRDF
================================================================================
* Look into connection pooling.
* investigate warning (encountered while crawling foaf:knows graph starting at TBL):
	2007-01-29 16:57:00:417 [WARNING] Rolling back transaction due to connection close

Ontologies
================================================================================
* ontology describing SemanticWebDocuments and where to get them

Testing
================================================================================
* syntax testing (both success and failure cases).  See:
  http://www.dajobe.org/2004/01/turtle/tests/
  http://www.w3.org/2000/10/rdf-tests/rdfcore/ntriples/test.nt
* test of HTTP URI dereferencing
* test of the context filter

Standards
================================================================================
* bring WurfelPrintStream into agreement with some identified set of RDF encoding practices

Use cases
================================================================================
* data hiding use case
* implicit context use case
* distributed programming use case
* DL or other reasoning use case
* later: concurrent programming use case

Demo / public web service
================================================================================
* buy more RAM for the server
* ask Chris Bizer about Jetty ^ dbpedia

Nice-to-have
================================================================================
* dbpedia interface
* geonames interface
* Swoogle add-on, which performs queries like the one below, then uses the
  result to grab potential models for importing.

* RDF-to-natural-language utilities -- express RDF as plain English, to some extent

Bugs
================================================================================
* repository import occasionally hangs.  Time it out so you don't have to quit the application
* forgot to close a connection somewhere:
  [WARNING] Closing dangling connection due to garbage collection
