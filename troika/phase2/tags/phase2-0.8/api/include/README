./libxml
    libxml 2.6.26 headers, for the sake of build platforms which have the
    libxml libraries but not the headers

./libxml/COPYING
    libxml copyright notice

./libxml/xmlversion.h
    This is normally generated from an xmlversion.h.in when building libxml for
    a specific platform.  As its contents do not directly affect the Phase2
    build, arbitrary values have been used, avoiding the inclusion of any
    nonstandard, non-libxml headers (specifically, iconv.h).

./phase2
    public Phase2 API headers
