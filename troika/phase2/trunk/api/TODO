[bugs]
    _mv and _new issues (^ source namespace)
    object ^ print ^ cycles

[general]
    fix all FIXMEs:
        grep FIXME `find -name \*.c` | more
    remove duplicate code in debug.c
    use String instead of char* for Encoders
    rework dependencies in collection, parser
    semaphores --> eliminate global variables
    "cstring" --> "String"

[build]
    try to get the package to build with pmake
    add "test" target
    tools dependencies (doxygen, xsltproc)
    svn log --> CHANGES
    include examples dir in distribution
    [ARM cross-compile]
         use static libraries

[high-level]
    define a canonical name ordering for objects without a unique shortest name
        apply it to both name-to-object and object-to-name mapping
    need a more general and flexible "model" scheme, ability to share atomic data among models
    rework Bunch to hold objects by value rather than by reference
    (possibly) eliminate boxed objects, use type inference exclusively

[docs]
    doxygen script --> revision # in docs

[import]
    wrap more standard library primitives
    add reduction primitives
    after importing primitives, check the type registry for incomplete types

[interpreter]
    _new ^ check whether object already exists

[namespace]
    break namespace__find into a path-building and a name-building portion

[parser]
    parser.c vs. Parser.c

[translation]
    RDF/XML and N3 import / export
    graceful fail when basic object (combinator/primitive/type) not found
    move the serialization stuff out of interpreter
