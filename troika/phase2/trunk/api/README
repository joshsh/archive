Introduction
================================================================================

Phase2 is an experimental language API and interpreter which combines ideas from
functional programming and the Semantic Web.  This is the continuation of an
undergraduate compiler project and is not aimed at any particular user niche.
Its purpose, beyond the learning experience of building a functional language
"from the ground up", is as a proof-of-concept for a programming paradigm (if
that's not too broad a term) based on the concept of triples in the sense of
the Resource Description Framework.  Phase2 is intended not as yet another RDF
toolkit, but as the basis for a family of languages expressed in triples and
which use triples as their fundamental data structure.  Documentation and code
samples are forthcoming.  Meanwhile...


Requirements
================================================================================

Note: a '+' indicates software versions which are known to be compatible with
      this distribution.  A '-' indicates incompatible (usually older) versions.

* GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) -- http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/
      + 4.0.2, 4.0.3
      IMPORTANT: Phase2 makes liberal use of the GNU C extension for nested
                 functions, and will not compile as ANSI C.
* GNU Make or equivalent -- http://www.gnu.org/software/make/
      Tested with: 3.80, 3.81beta4
* GNU Libtool -- http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/
      + 1.5.16, 1.5.22
* libxml2 (with libxml-2.0.pc) -- http://xmlsoft.org/
      For Debian users: "sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev"


Compiling Phase2
================================================================================

The Phase2 package uses autotools and is built in the usual way:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

But I usually do something this:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-debug
    $ make 2>stderr.txt; cat stderr.txt

Now:

    $ make install

See ./INSTALL for more details.


Running the interpreter
================================================================================

To invoke the interpeter with no input data set:

    $ phase2

Or (if you have not installed):

    $ ./src/phase2

To load a data set:

    $ phase2 -f myfile.p2

Once you're talking to the interpreter, type "_help;" (without quotes) for some
introductory information.

Also try:

    $ phase2 --help


Building Phase2 from scratch
================================================================================

To build Phase2 from scratch you will need the following additional tools:

* GNU Autoconf -- http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
      + 2.59
* GNU Automake -- http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
      + 1.9.5, 1.9.6
      - 1.4-p6
* GNU Bison or equivalent -- http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/
      + 2.0, 2.1
* GNU Flex or equivalent -- http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/
      + 2.5.31, 2.5.33
* dot -- http://www.graphviz.org/
      + 2.2.1, 2.8
* doxygen -- http://www.doxygen.org/
      + 1.4.4
* xsltproc -- http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/
      + 20620

    $ ./cleanup
    $ ./bootstrap

Now ./configure and make as usual.


Bugs
================================================================================

Please send bug reports to parcour@gmail.com or use the bug tracker at:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/phase2/

At this point I have only built Phase2 for two different platforms, and welcome
any comments on how it behaved on other machines.
