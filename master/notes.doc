there should be a central system file which encodes information about the present
  (or saved) state of the system (colors, etc.) which the user can change via
  the interface.  In this file (or files, maybe one for each *.h that needs a
  place in it; for example fractal.per to fractal.h, storing useful data about
  the fractals, for instance, interesting sites in the Mandelbrot set.  There
  should be no limit to the size of such a file, which should be built to be as
  user-friendly as possible, e.g. allowing such things as marginal notes about
  the Mandelbrot location, etc.  Perhaps it would be wise even to create a 
  separate folder for each *.h needing storage space, if within these *.h
  data of different sorts must be stored)
  
create a "programmer's *.h" which has to do with testing such things as the
  running time of a function, etc.  For this I'll have to learn about that
  function-linking, or whatever it is called. 
  
NEVER include strings.h (even a file consisting of nothing more than
  "#include <strings.h>" and the main() produces a page full of errors, 
  so there's something very wrong with it!)
