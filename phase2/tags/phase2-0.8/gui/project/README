This is a graphical browser tool for Phase2.  For now, it simply lets you
navigate within a namespace.  Planned features include editing and
expression-building, as well as a "free form" layout which allows you to
associate collection elements with position data (see
./src/layout/P2FreeFormLayout.h).

                        --- Prerequisites ---

                              - Qt4 -

You'll need the Qt4 libraries to build p2gui, as well as Trolltech qmake,
the source for which is available here:

    http://www.trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/index

Note: installing Qt from source takes significant time and system resources.

                            - Phase2 -

If you have not already installed Phase2, the GUI is rather pointless (and
more imminently, it won't compile).  So get the api/interpreter package
here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/phase2

You should have configured Phase2 to put the headers and libraries where you
want them, e.g.

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

...then installed (as root if necessary):

    $ make install

                            - libxml2 -

See the Phase2 README.

                        --- Compiling p2gui ---

From the p2gui directory, create a qmake project file:

    $ qmake -project -o p2gui.pro

Now append some information which will tell the Makefile where to look for
the libxml2 libraries and the phase2 libraries and headers.  If you've
installed to a directory other than /usr you'll need to change this
appropriately.

    $ echo "INCPATH += /usr/include/phase2" >> p2gui.pro
    $ echo "LIBS += -lphase2 -lxml2" >> p2gui.pro
    $ echo "QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -Wno-deprecated" >> p2gui.pro

Now generate the Makefile:

    $ qmake

Finally, make the executable:

    $ make

                  --- Ignore everything below this line ---

...unless you're me and you're cross-compiling.
