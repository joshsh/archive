# No named parameters:

@define sq:
    dup! mul!.

    
# This is dumb, because it requires different @define syntax for relations
# with and without named parameters:

@define sq(x):
    x x mul!.

    
# This is better...

@define sq x:
    x x mul!.
   
    
# This may be best of all, because it looks like a rewrite rule:

@define x sq:
    x x mul!.
