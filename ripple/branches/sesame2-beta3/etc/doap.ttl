	doap:description "Ripple is a scripting language expressed in RDF lists.  Its scripts both operate upon and are made up of RDF metadata, extending the idea of HTTP dereferenceability to computation.  Ripple is a variation on the 'concatenative' theme of functional, stack-oriented languages such as Joy and Factor, and distinguishes itself through a multivalued, 'pipeline' approach to query composition, as well as the inherent distributability of its programs.  The Java implementation of Ripple includes a query engine, a provisonal assortment of primitive functions, and an interactive interpreter which parses commands and queries in a readable, Turtle-like format.";
