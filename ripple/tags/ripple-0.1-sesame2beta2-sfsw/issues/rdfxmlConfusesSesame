The offending FOAF file:
    <http://web.mit.edu/hmslydia/Public/foaf.rdf#hmslydia>

He knows her, but as soon as her graph is dereferenced, the parser is useless (with the same ModelConnection):
	<http://people.csail.mit.edu/crowell/foaf.rdf#crowell>


We never see his info:
	<http://web.mit.edu/dsheets/www/foaf.rdf#dsheets>

When querying:
	<http://people.csail.mit.edu/crowell/foaf.rdf#crowell>;
	<http://people.csail.mit.edu/crowell/foaf.rdf#crowell> knows;
	@serql "CONSTRUCT * FROM {x} p {y}";
	@quit;
