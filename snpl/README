August 24, 2006 ========================

I believe this is the latest version of SNPL, which I am now committing to
my projects repository.  It looks as though I had left off in the middle of
some changes to file names, as I had to fix the #includes in various places to
get the project to compile.  This is probably from the middle of January, 2005.

# Install flex, bison, SDL and SDL_image in Ubuntu Dapper:
sudo apt-get install flex
sudo apt-get install bison
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl-image1.2
cd <SDL_image source dir>
sudo cp SDL_image.h /usr/include/SDL
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libSDL_image-1.2.so.0 /usr/lib/libSDL_image.so

# Build everything
make

# Run SParse
./sparse

SNPL is no longer an active project, but questions and comments are welcome.
