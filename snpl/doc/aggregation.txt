ADVENTURES IN AGGREGATION

* Replacement of hash table lookups with pointer offsetting, e.g.
    a value  -->  a + ["value" offset]
    
* Arrays via associational chaining
    a prev  -->  a - [size of a's aggregate type]

* Consolidating Church integers, e.g.
    a next next  -->  a + (2*[sizeof a])
    a (next (#16 times))  -->  a + (16*[sizeof a])

* Bounds checking for "aggregated" data structures, e.g.
    d next2 next2 next2  -->  [0] (array out-of-bounds)
    d next1  -->  [0] (key mismatch, if this is possible)
    
* Cyclical data structures, e.g.
    Sunday (next (#7 times))  -->  Sunday
